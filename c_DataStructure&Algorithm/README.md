# Data Structure & Algorithm

---

## Data Structure
A **data structure** is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. You can think of it as a container, like a box. When you want to store something in the box, you need a suitable structure to organize it.
In data structures, the most important operations are **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)**.

## Algorithm
An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It's the method or process for manipulating the data inside your data structure. You can think of it like using different tools (like hands, feet, or robotic arms) to get things done in the most efficient way.
In algorithms, the most important part is how to perform the operations **efficiently** and **quickly**.
